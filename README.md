# DispersalSGS

Using the neon goby Elacatinus lori as a model system, I am investigating whether contemporary dispersal patterns can be used to predict the spatial genetic structure (SGS) that has evolved over time. I will predict SGS by simulating the evolution of genomes moving through the contemporary seascape according to E. lori’s validated dispersal patterns, using the genomic simulation software SLiM. Then I will compare my simulated predictions to empirical SGS data to gain insights about the ecological processes that are most significant to the formation of SGS in a real, complex seascape. Finally, I will extend these methods to generate testable predictions about SGS in portions of E. lori’s range where those data are not available.
